The world has been engulfed in darkness after a great calamity. With humans trapped in their very own homes, streets once flourishing with life have been deserted. The local populous survival depends on the few brave willing to risk everything to provide for others.

Undivided is a game about coming together and unifying as one to overcome hardship.
